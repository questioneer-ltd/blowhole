blowhole is a tool for creating, managing, and using docker-based development (or other) environments.

Features
--------

* Build environments using modular cross-distro components
* Pass through system services (X-Org, audio, gpg-agent, etc.)
* Use fancy terminal multiplexing
* Run locally or on a remote system via SSH
* Develop additional modules easily

Development
-----------

blowhole is currently in very early development, but should do something soon hopefully maybe.
